# california-housing-prices-linear-regression-models
In this dataset we have to predict the final prices of the houses from features given. 

Introduction

In this we delve into predicting California house prices using linear regression. We will explore the dataset, visualize key features, and build a model to forecast housing prices based on various attributes. The visualizations will help in understanding the data distribution and the relationships between features, ultimately aiming to provide insights into the factors influencing housing prices in California.

Real Estate Price Prediction: Process We Followed
Below is the process we followed for predicting real estate prices using linear regression, aimed at helping make informed decisions in the real estate market analysis:

Gather Data: We sourced a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, which includes various features related to California housing prices . This dataset is ideal for our analysis and prediction tasks.

Data Preparation: The collected data was cleaned and prepared by handling missing values, removing outliers, and converting categorical variables into numerical formats.

Feature Engineering: We created and transformed features to capture essential information that influences housing prices. This step involved adding new variables and modifying existing ones to improve model performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We explored and visualized the data to understand its distribution, correlations, and patterns. This analysis provided insights into the relationships between features and the target variable.

Model Selection: We applied linear regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm, to predict house prices based on the features provided. Linear regression was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in modeling relationships between variables.

Model Training and Evaluation: The linear regression model was trained on the prepared dataset, with careful tuning of parameters to enhance prediction accuracy. We evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics to ensure reliable predictions.

For this analysis, we used historical data with various features impacting property prices. You can download the dataset from Kaggle here:/kaggle/input/california-housing-prices and /kaggle/input/california-housing-feature-engineering
